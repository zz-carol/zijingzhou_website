There are 38218, 38204, 38218, 38201, and 191243 individuals in the Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Self, Neighbors, and Control groups.

The sub-sample 2006 primary turnout in Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Self, Neighbors, and Control levels are 0.31, 0.32, 0.35, 0.38, and 0.30.

```{r}
mu_hat_civic - mu_hat_control
mu_hat_haw - mu_hat_civic
mu_hat_self - mu_hat_haw
mu_hat_neib - mu_hat_self
```
The treatment effects of Civic Duty vs. Control is 0.018, of Hawthorne vs. Civic Duty is 0.0078, of Self vs. Hawthorne is 0.023, and of Neighbors vs. Self is 0.033. This indicates that each treatment is more effective than the one previous, Neighbors being the most effective.

The 95% confidence interval for Civic Duty is (0.013, 0.023), for Hawthorne is (0.00094, 0.013), for Self is (0.017, 0.029), and for Neighbors is (0.025, 0.039).

(f)
```{r}
lm1 = lm(outcome ~ civic + haw + self + neib, data = vote)
stargazer(lm1, type = "text", title = "The Results of the Pre-treatment Covariates")
```
The outcome for Control is 0.297. The slope of Civic Duty is 0.018, of Hawthorne is 0.026, of Self is 0.049, and of Neighbor is 0.081. When there are no treatments, the turnout rate is 2.6%. When people are assigned to treatments, each treatment is more effective than the one previous since each turnout rate is higher than the previous one.

The outcome for Control is 0.077.

The turnout rates for Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Self, and Neighbor are very similar to the results in part (f).

Randomized experiments report balance tables because the tables can help detect errors. I think the balance on age between the treatment and control group is good because they have similar numbers of individuals in each age group. 

(b)
```{r}
mean(whi$breastcancer[whi$treat==1]) - mean(whi$breastcancer[whi$treat==0])
```
The overall treatment effect is 0.0051, meaning there were slightly less individuals in the treatment group developed invasive breast cancer than the placebo group.

(c)
```{r}
n_ite = 1000
tau_ceempa = rep(NA, n_ite)
n_sample = nrow(whi)

  index_bs = sample(1:n_sample, n_sample, T)
  df_bs = whi[index_bs,]
  tau_ceempa[i] = mean(df_bs$breastcancer[df_bs$treat==1]) - mean(df_bs$breastcancer[df_bs$treat==0])
}
quantile(tau_ceempa, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
The 95% confidence interval is (0.00079, 0.0094).

(d)
```{r}
whi_50 = subset(whi, age=="50-59")

whi_70 = subset(whi, age=="70-79")
mean(whi_70$breastcancer[whi_70$treat==1]) - mean(whi_70$breastcancer[whi_70$treat==0])
```
The treatment effects of CEE+MPA on breast cancer within the 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 group are 0.0037, 0.0046, and 0.0082 respectively.

quantile(tau_60, c(0.025, 0.975))
quantile(tau_70, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
The 95% confidence interval of the 50-59 group is (-0.0033, 0.011), of the 60-69 group is (-0.0018, 0.011), and of the 70-79 group is (-0.0026, 0.019). This means you can be 95% certain that the true mean of the population is within those ranges for the different age groups.

(i)
In (d), the estimated treatment effects within the 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 group are 0.0037, 0.0046, and 0.0082 respectively. The results of the interactive model are similar to the results of (d), while the results of the addictive model are different. The difference between (f) and (g) is that (g) has two more terms, 60-69 * treatment and 70-79 * treatment, as regressors.

Dogs
```{r}
dog = read.csv("dogs.csv")

stargazer(lm5, type = "text", title = "The Results of Regressing Weight on Gender and Fixed")
```

(b)
```{r}

(c)
```{r}

(g)
```{r}
mean(dog$Weight[dog$fixed==1 & dog$female==1], na.rm = T)
mean(dog$Weight[dog$fixed==0 & dog$female==1], na.rm = T)
mean(dog$Weight[dog$fixed==1 & dog$female==0], na.rm = T)
mean(dog$Weight[dog$fixed==0 & dog$female==0], na.rm = T)
```
The sub-sample mean weights among fixed females, unfixed females, fixed males, and unfixed males are 44.4, 46.02, 47.34, and 43.58. The sub-sample mean weight of fixed females and fixed males are similar to the estimated weight of those calculated by the addictive model. The results of (g) are similar to the estimated weights calculated by the interactive model of (e).
