# Welcome to Zijing (Carol) Zhou Personal Website

Hi. My name is Zijing (Carol) Zhou. I am a recent Emory graduate majoring in Statistics (Informatics Track) and Biology. This website contains coding projects I have worked on in and outside of classes.

## Piantadosi Lab
This folder contains work I have done for my research lab. 
* The spike-in project's goal is to establish a cutoff for the number of spike-in reads per sequencing batch using R and statistics. 
* The Major League Soccer project looks at the evolutionary history of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a soccer league using Nextstrain and UShER. 
* The Omicron project investigates whether the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged before the reported date of November 2021 using UShER, TreeTime, and BEAST 2. 
* I also contributed to two papers. 
  * The Binax paper (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/13/24-1191_article#) was about using negative COVID-19 swabs to detect other respiratory viruses for surveillance purposes. I contributed by generating the phylogenetic trees for parainfluenza virusesâ€”curating related sequences from public databases, incorporating our study's sequences, and conducting a literature review to inform clade classification.
  * The upcoming SeroNet paper investigates how COVID-19 evolves within immunocompromised patients over time. I contributed by creating heat maps to analyze mutation frequencies across different SARS-CoV-2 variants, helping to characterize within-host evolutionary patterns. The manuscript is currently in final editing and will be submitted soon.

## School Projects
This folder contains work/projects I have done for school courses, separated by programming languages (Python, R, SQL, Java, etc.) and then by courses. My friends and I also developed a recipe upload and searching website (GitHub: https://github.com/pnellis/Foodiology).

## Scripps Research
This folder contains works I did for the Andersen Lab at Scripps Research during the summer internship. My project was about investigating the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in South Africa. All analysis was done in R.
