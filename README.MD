# Welcome to Zijing (Carol) Zhou Personal Website

Hi. My name is Zijing (Carol) Zhou. I am a fourth-year student studying Biology and Statistics (Informatics Track) at Emory. This website contains coding projects I have worked on in and outside classes.

## Piantadosi Lab
This folder contains works I have done for my research lab. The spike-in project's goal is to establish a cutoff for the number of spike-in reads per sequencing batch using R and statistics. The Major League Soccer project looks at the evolutionary history of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a soccer league using Nextstrain and UShER. The Omicron project investigates whether the SARS-Cov-2 Omicron variant emerged before the reported date of November 2021. I am also currently helping with the publication of two papers. The Binax paper was submitted for review and right now is under revision. The SeroNet paper is still in the writing process but will be submitted soon.

## School Projects
This folder contains work/projects I have done for school courses, separated by course number.

## Scripps Research
This folder contains works I did for the Andersen Lab at Scripps Research during the summer internship. My project was about investigating the epidemiological, geospatial, and phylogenetic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in South Africa.
